# WatchThis Sharing Service Implementation Plan

## Project Status Overview

The `watchthis-sharing-service` is the core service that enables users to share media content with friends in the WatchThis platform. This service acts as the bridge between users, connecting the media service with the inbox service to create a complete sharing ecosystem.

**ðŸš§ PHASE 1 IN PROGRESS** - Core sharing operations and service structure

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Sharing Operations ðŸš§ IN PROGRESS

#### ðŸŸ¡ High Priority - MVP Functionality

##### 1. Service Structure âœ… COMPLETED

## Database Schema Design

### Share Collection

```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  mediaId: ObjectId,           // Reference to media-service
  fromUserId: ObjectId,        // Sender (user-service)
  toUserId: ObjectId,          // Recipient (user-service)
  message: String,             // Optional message (max 500 chars)
  status: {
    type: String,
    enum: ['pending', 'watched', 'archived'],
    default: 'pending'
  },
  watchedAt: Date,             // When marked as watched
  createdAt: {
    type: Date,
    default: Date.now
  },
  updatedAt: {
    type: Date,
    default: Date.now
  }
}
```

### Database Indexes

```javascript
// Performance indexes
db.shares.createIndex({ fromUserId: 1, createdAt: -1 });
db.shares.createIndex({ toUserId: 1, status: 1, createdAt: -1 });
db.shares.createIndex({ mediaId: 1 });
db.shares.createIndex({ status: 1, createdAt: -1 });

// Compound indexes for common queries
db.shares.createIndex({ toUserId: 1, status: 1 });
db.shares.createIndex({ fromUserId: 1, status: 1 });
```

}
```

## Service Integration Architecture

### Authentication Flow

```
1. User makes request with session cookie
2. Sharing service validates session with user service
3. Extract user ID from validated session
4. Use user ID for share operations
```

### Media Validation Flow

```
1. User attempts to share media item
2. Sharing service validates media exists via media service
3. Create share record with validated media reference
4. Publish share event for other services
```

### Event Publishing

```typescript
// Share events for other services
interface ShareCreatedEvent {
  type: "SHARE_CREATED";
  shareId: string;
  mediaId: string;
  fromUserId: string;
  toUserId: string;
  message?: string;
  timestamp: Date;
}

interface ShareWatchedEvent {
  type: "SHARE_WATCHED";
  shareId: string;
  mediaId: string;
  userId: string;
  watchedAt: Date;
  timestamp: Date;
}
```
