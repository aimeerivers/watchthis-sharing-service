## API Endpoints

### Core Sharing Operations âœ… FULLY IMPLEMENTED

```
POST   /api/v1/shares           # Create new share
GET    /api/v1/shares/:id       # Get share details
PATCH  /api/v1/shares/:id       # Update share (mark as watched, etc.)
DELETE /api/v1/shares/:id       # Delete/archive share

GET    /api/v1/shares/sent      # Get shares sent by user
GET    /api/v1/shares/received  # Get shares received by user
GET    /api/v1/shares/stats     # Get sharing statistics
```

**Note:** All endpoints are functional and tested. Authentication integration is pending - currently requires `userId` in query params or `fromUserId` in request body.

### Health and Monitoring

```
GET    /health                  # Service health check
GET    /ping                    # Simple status check
```

## Database Schema

### Share Collection

```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  mediaId: ObjectId,           // Reference to media service
  fromUserId: ObjectId,        // Sender (reference to user service)
  toUserId: ObjectId,          // Recipient (reference to user service)
  message: String,             // Optional message with the share
  status: String,              // 'pending', 'watched', 'archived'
  watchedAt: Date,             // When marked as watched
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

## Architecture Integration

This service integrates with the WatchThis ecosystem:

- **Authentication**: Validates users via watchthis-user-service
- **Media Validation**: Verifies media items via watchthis-media-service
- **Event Publishing**: Publishes share events for inbox and notification services
- **Health Monitoring**: Provides health checks for service discovery

## Format code

The project uses ESLint and Prettier to ensure consistent coding standards.

```bash
npm run lint
npm run format
npm run package:lint
```

- `lint` will check for errors and fix formatting in `.ts` and `.js` files.
- `format` will apply format rules to all possible files.
- `package:lint` will warn of any inconsistencies in the `package.json` file.
